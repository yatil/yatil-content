Aaron Gustafson on a [common design issue](http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/web-design-101-100-percent-tappable/): Buttons and links that canâ€™t be clicked everywhere where the visual click area seems to be. In addition, remember that buttons or links need to be activated using the keyboard which means that `<a>` elements need to have a `href` attribute, for example.
