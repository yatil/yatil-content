Over on Twitter, I found a video of an exciting accessibility talk, but it was not captioned. In Overcast, I see many podcasts focusing on accessibility that do not have transcripts available[^My friend [Nic blogged about missing podcast transcripts](https://incl.ca/people-transcripts-and-money/) lately.]. I see accessibility articles with missing alternative texts and accessibility infographics that have no long description. I have used inaccessible accessibility testing tools. Accessibility reports are often delivered in inaccessible PDFs.

**This must stop.**

If people _in_ the accessibility community canâ€™t make it work, who can? Yes, captions and transcripts are expensive and/or time-consuming. But making your content inaccessible for D/deaf or hard of hearing people weakens your point.

We have to lead by example, even if it is difficult.
