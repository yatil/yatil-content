Jeremy [posted a solution for multi-language sites](https://adactio.com/notes/13720) where you want to switch hyphenation on when the page language is set to (for example) German:

``` css
[lang="de"] { hyphens: auto; }
```

This works great until you have code on the page. Even if we have word-wrapping for code enabled (and we should on responsive sites), hyphenation is not what we want, usually. The same goes for code in sentences. So Iâ€™d suggest adding the following to the CSS: 

``` css
[lang="de"] pre, [lang="de"] code { hyphens: none; }
```
