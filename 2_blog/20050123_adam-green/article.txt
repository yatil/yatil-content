Text:
Hab ihn bei Harald Schmidt gesehen und war sofort tief beeindruckt. Seine Gedichte **muss** man ja nicht lesen, aber die Musik ist sehr melodisch.

> I just don’t care about the evening news  
> I never listen to the crackhouse blues  
> They say the city is the place to be  
> I wanna dance with Emily  
> Everybody come around the window shop  
> I guess they never seen the moves I got  
> I wanna be with what the people see  
> I wanna dance with Emily  
>   
> Emily, sweet baby, won’t you be my wife  
> Cutting me wide open with a kitchen knife  
> Everybody said that she is underage  
> Honky tried to shoot me with a 7 gage  
>   
> Now I got the cookies that your momma sent  
> I got permission from the government  
> Someone should mention to the minister  
> Now I gotta dance with Jennifer  
>   
> Jenny’s got a mousehole full of pigeon scum  
> On top a mountain made of bubble gum  
> Don’t understand what all the grief is for  
> Now I gotta dance with Eleanor  
>   
> Eleanor, I wonder if we grew too slow  
> Straight down the hatch beneath the streetlight’s glow  
> Baby when I get you on that persian rug  
> That’s the kind of movies I’ve been dreaming of  
>   
> I’ll tell you something that you’d think I know  
> I got two tickets to the sold out show  
> Some of the fellas like to think I’m Greek  
> I wanna love you maybe three days a week  
>   
> I just don’t care about the evening news  
> I never listen to the crackhouse blues  
> I wanna be with what the people see  
> I wanna dance with Emily  
> I wanna dance with Emily
