Letterboxd is a nice website for film nerds. You can track what you have watched when and how you have liked the movie. They have just released their [2014 year in review page](http://letterboxd.com/2014/) which is really impressive. It is quite heavy (over 3MB) but uses really large photos, so there is basically no war around it. I love such carefully designed individual pages.
