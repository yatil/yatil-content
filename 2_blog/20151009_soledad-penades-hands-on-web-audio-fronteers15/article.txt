- You can generate audio using JavaScript
- Tiny new language 
  - small vocabulary
  - few grammar rules
  - couple of ideoms
- AudioContext 
  - like canvas
  - toolbox
  - instance factory
- Nodes Taxonomy 
  - Generation
  - Manipulation
  - Analysis
- Audio Context as audio graph
- Modular routing
- Sound modulation 
  - connect() helps you to modulate from one node to another
- Gain nodes
- …
- Don’t keep nodes
- stop and disconnect sound sources
- load binary data
- decode into a buffer
- create buffer source and use it
- you can even bend the pitch of the audio live
- place sounds in 2D space – StereoPanner 
  - Place to left change pan attribute to -1, to right to +1
- For 3D space, for example in Games, use Panner 
  - update position for accurate placement
  - tries to be realistically physical, so the unit is meters
- BiquadFilter 
  - Let certain frequencies pass
- Analyser for Visuals 
  - Real time frequency and time-domain information
- Getting creative 
  - Real time input + processing
  - Get user media + echoing
- Web audio is minimal and powerful 
  - many built-in nodes
  - one graph, simple connect rules
  - sound generation, processing and analysis
  - great for games, VR and interactive applications
  - it’s also fun!
- Web audio meetups in London & Berlin
