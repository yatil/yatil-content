Speaking at the FronteersJam for the third time this year was really a blast again. Instead of talking about accessibility again like in [2010](http://www.slideshare.net/yatil/fronteers-jam-session-principles-of-accessible-web-design) and [2011](https://speakerdeck.com/yatil/fronteers11-jam-session-a11y-goes-to-11), I opted for a more general theme: Defaults. Or making choices beforehand, so your life gets easier because you already know answers before you encounter a problem. Thanks to the organizers, all [Fronteers(Jam) talks are available or will me made available online online](http://vimeo.com/channels/fronteers12), including [mine](http://vimeo.com/51897717) : And here are the slides, [without notes](https://speakerdeck.com/yatil/fronteers12) and [with notes](https://speakerdeck.com/yatil/how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-defaults-w). (Speakerdeckâ€™s embedding option seems not to work here. Need to investigate that.)
