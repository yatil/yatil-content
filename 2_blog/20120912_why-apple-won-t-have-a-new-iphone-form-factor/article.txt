I think [Thomas Baekdal](http://www.baekdal.com) [is exactly right](http://www.baekdal.com/insights/apple-is-the-new-porsche-911/): They think they found the best design, now they need only to realign and tweak.

> If you expect Apple to come out with a completely new design, you haven’t been paying attention to what Apple has done for the past 7 years. They don’t experiment with design anymore. They find the essence of a shape within the limitations of today’s technology.
