Everything’s shiny and new around here! And it’s not just a visual refresh, the technology here is all new. I’ve switched from my beloved [Textpattern CMS](http://textpattern.com/) to [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/). I didn’t expect that to happen, but it allows me to create content for this English and the German website at [yatil.de](http://yatil.de) from the same backend. Also the Website is [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/)ified thanks to the tremendous work of [Matthias Pfefferle](http://notizblog.org/). He created the [Sempress theme](http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/sempress/) and [various nifty Wordpress plugins](http://profiles.wordpress.org/pfefferle/). With Textpattern I would have developed most functionality myself and I don’t think that I would have found the time to do it. The transition was painlessful. For example I had to go through each and every post and remove excerpts that were created automatically. Also there were no featured images carried over from Textpattern, so I had to assign them manually as well. That has been quite a bit of work for articles reaching back to 2004. I tried to catch everything, but there may be some rough edges around here. Main objective of the transition was to post stuff more efficiently, the wide-spread integration and tools available for Wordpress really help there. Please keep the webmentions coming, so I can be sure everything works.
