Great video over at the [Google Chrome Developers channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw) about the upcoming [CSS Level 4 `:focus-ring` selector (draft)](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focusring-pseudo). The focus is often removed for stylistic reasons when using the mouse, but then keyboard users also have no indication of where they are on the website. `:focus-ring` solves that issue.
