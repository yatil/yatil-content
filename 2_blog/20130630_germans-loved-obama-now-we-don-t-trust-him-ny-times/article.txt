Malte Spitz [in the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/opinion/sunday/germans-loved-obama-now-we-dont-trust-him.html?pagewanted=all) on the relationship of Germans and Obama:

> While our respective security services still need to collaborate on both sides of the Atlantic to pursue and prevent organized crime and terrorism, it must be done in a way that strengthens civil liberties and does not reduce them. Although we would like to believe in the Mr. Obama we once knew, the trust and credibility he enjoyed in Germany have been undermined. The challenge we face is to once again find shared values, so that trust between our countries is restored.

(In 2009 I even backed the [Designing Obama Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simplescott/designing-obama) and even paid additional 50 Dollars to appear as a silver sponsor by name in it. The book is still great, but the change that was promised to us never happened in regards of privacy.) /via [Marco Zehe](http://www.marcozehe.de/) on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/marco.zehe.hamburg/posts/132819420260020)
