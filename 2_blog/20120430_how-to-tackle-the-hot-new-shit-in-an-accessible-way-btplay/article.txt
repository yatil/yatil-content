[Slides](http://yatil.net/talks/2012-btplay/)I held a similar talk to the one at FrontendUnited at “beyond tellerrand — play!” in Cologne the same week. It went quite well and [@marcthiele](http://twitter.com/marcthiele) was an awesome host. Learned a lot about Flash techniques and general playing with technologies at that conference, so a really good view over the “tellerrand” for me.
