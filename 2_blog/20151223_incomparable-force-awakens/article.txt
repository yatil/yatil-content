My personal thoughts about “The Force Awakens” are very well mirrored by the discussion on last week’s [The Incomparable, Episode 277: Stormtroopers Are People](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/277/index.php). The panel consists of Jason Snell, Serenity Caldwell, Dan Moren and the [hypercritical](http://hypercritical.co/about/) John Siracusa. I think that Siracusa’s characterization of the movie (around the 2h45 mark) is especially noteworthy, where he states that he managed to judge the movie for its own merits and not to have unfair expectations.
