Just got that email:

> Hi, I would like to invite you to promote yatil.de on search engines by participating in free automatic link building system – \[REDACTED\]. \[…\] **This email was sent after finding your site on Google.**

So, if you find my site via google, why should I care about your service that makes me findable via google?
