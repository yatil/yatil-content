> The playwright Brendan Behan once said that the first issue on any Irish agenda was a split. For the IRA, that has constantly been the case. From the Old IRA, the paramilitary army of the Irish Republic came a minority who formed the Anti-Treaty IRA, which became the Official IRA, from which broke away the Provisional IRA. It then had its own breakaways, namely the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, each claiming to be successor of the Army of the Irish Republic. Most Irish people, however, disagree with their claims, and these groups do not enjoy the level of support the Provisionals had. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army "en")

Das könnte ganz schön kompliziert werden…
