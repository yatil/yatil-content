> I’m going to continue to publish here on my own website, journal, blog, or whatever you want to call it. It’s still possible that I might lose everything but I’d rather take the responsibility for that, rather than placing my trust in ”the cloud” someone else’s server. I’m owning my own words.

[Really good article](http://adactio.com/journal/6620/) on why we should host our content ourselves and why it is so hard to understand for younger people. This is a must-read!
