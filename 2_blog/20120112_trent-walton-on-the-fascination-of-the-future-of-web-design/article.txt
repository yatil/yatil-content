> For what it’s worth, it’s stuff like \[vertical media queries\] that gets me excited about the future of web design. We’re leaping past any point where the word webpage makes any sense, and into a a world where what is seen at any one screen size (or Photoshop comp) only captures a sliver of the display capability responsive websites muster. — [Trent Walton](http://trentwalton.com/2012/01/11/vertical-media-queries-wide-sites)

I’m so looking forward to seeing him talk next week in Nottingham.
