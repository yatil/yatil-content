I’ve just pimped my RSS feed to directly include links and some fancy UTF-8 icons to indicate if it is a link or article. You can now click directly on the title of a link post (like this one) and you won’t be redirected through my site. Please note that I’ve abandoned Feedburner. A redirection is in place, but just make sure that the correct URL is in your RSS-Reader of choice: http://yatil.net/rss-feed
