- Motivated for the moral of accessibility.
- But it is a good question to ask about the business case
- What is gov.uk 
  - Best place to find government services in the UK
  - One single design of the government sites
  - 9m visits/week
  - 330 departments/organization
  - saved £1.7 billion in tax money
  - tried to make gov.uk as accessible as possible
  - first: inaccessible prototype 
      - Sent troubling message to users
  - beta: built for inclusion
  - aim: most easy to use and accessible website of a government that there has been
  - regular research with people w/ disabilities
  - screen reader tests
  - hiring accessibility experts
  - it is in the design principles
- “What I mean by ‘accessibility’?” 
  - Four impairments: 
      - visual
      - hearing
      - ???
      - cognitive
  - Fonts are important, for example some people use the Open Dyslexic font.
  - Some improvements are not technology based: color choices, information architecture, sentence length…
  - Making the site accessible would mean supporting a variety of technologies
  - Tricky decisions where you need to make a decision that helps a set of people but is not improving the page for other users
  - Making sites accessible makes financial sense for governments. 
      - PwD do get what they need anyway, for instance they might call which is much more expensive.
  - Closed system in government
  - But in private PwD can go somewhere else
- Writing a business case for accessibility 
  - This is the magic answer how making your web site accessible will make you rich. – Naïve view.
  - Good business case takes a problem that you have
  - Come up to solutions to that problems
  - Which solution is the best (will be accessibility because that’s what the talk is about ;-)
  - We should solve X
  - Anecdotal evidence: SEO, maintenance, revenue from PwD, older people
  - Search for the most cost effective way to solve the problem. Is that accessibility?
  - A good business case should find the most effective solution.
  - Only real business case is litigation.
  - Duty to make reasonable adjustments in UK law
  - But most people don’t care about the UK
  - In the Netherlands: AWGB (Algemene Wet Gelijke Behandeling) – Equal treatment act.
  - Public sector: Webrichtlijnen – quite advanced
  - No case has it ever made to court in the Netherlands
  - In the UK usually settling outside of court to avoid embarrassment
  - When in the US things are going to court, there are fines and embarrassment
  - If low profile company the chances to get sued is quite low vs. the cost of making your site accessible
  - Maybe no business case for accessibility for small companies
  - But…
- You don’t need a business case. 
  - If you build a site from scratch, why not just do it. It is not too hard. And, as [Scott](/?p=101753) said, access is our job.
  - Sneak it in, if you have to.
  - 4 levels to how much you care or are able to care about accessibility 
      1. Don’t screw up HTML 
            - A lot comes with accessibility built in
            - Gets you 90% of the way – that’s better than 85% out there.
            - Headings are shown as an outline
            - PwD will often search for those headings or landmarks 
                    - There is quite a patchy understanding of landmarks by users, main is well known at the moment
            - Links need to be descriptive, or you just end up with a list of “click here“s.
      2. Check with tools: 
            - WAVE or tenon helps you
            - WAVE: low effort, shows warnings and alerts inline
            - Tenon is an API, you POST to it, get JSON back. Integrates into the built process.
            - Example: Fronteers Website – 1 Error: A <p> element that is empty (only inputs in there)
            - Tenon allows you to fix those and read about the reasoning and severity of the error
      3. Test with assistive technology 
            - You’ll never get as good with a screen reader as a permanent screen reader user
            - But very interesting insights
            - Especially with interactive components
            - You want to test if your browser understands what you want to tell him.
            - Looks like JAWS won’t be the most prominent screen reader in the near future.
            - Browser and accessibility APIs are buggy
            - dd:first-letter {text-transform: uppercase;} caused Chrome+VO to read the first character another time.
            - In chrome there is an accessibility tab in about:flag
            - File bugs!!
            - So a visual style beaks the site for non-visual users
            - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
      4. Ask an expert 
            - Someone who is good at accessibility testing is very important – at GDS: Léonie Watson
  - For most of those you don’t need a business case.
  - „When accessibility becomes part of what you do, of course it’s free“

- Summary: 
  - Good business cases for accessibility are hard to write.
