- Create a company that is not a web dev dactories
- Challenge: How to do creative work and still get paid.
- Clients & 💩 
  - Getting work: If you don’t have clients, there’s no business.
  - You need to find good clients.
  - Really challenging. How to find good clients?
  - You need to balance two things: 
      - Build relationships
      - Tedious pitching
  - Love all(most) all clients, fired one client – this is tough
  - You have certain views of how your clients should be.
  - But sometimes you wake up and the client is not as easy to work with as you imagine.
  - Pitching is fun, but the idea is crazy.
  - You have to stand in front of someone and present your work, often unpaid.
  - You need to balance the time.
  - You don’t want to be under or over prepared.
  - Example: Pitched for hotel chain in brussels, had good feeling, well prepared. Budget 130.000€ 
      - About 6 or 7 other agencies did also pitch, didn’t win. Client went with a agency they have had a personal connection with.
  - Best client that just wanted to have a talk about the project approach.
  - Only payed once for a pitch.
  - Project management
  - Working in agile way: not directly building the car, but building a bike first and then a motorcycle
  - People don’t read specs, don’t do too much of them.
  - Agile is tricky.
  - Bad experience, clients don’t understand what the concept of agile is.
  - Clients often do not prioritize their features properly.
  - They use sprintr + basecamp together with transparency and communication. Do more work and less management.
  - **Be honest.**
- Design & 💩 
  - Design is about communicating an idea, the user journey.
  - Not talking about implementation.
  - Design should be brief but an idea needs to be conveyed.
  - Struggle with “content” and “best practice”
  - Content 
      - Really, really important
      - Designers and content creators working together in print to deliver a proper design for the content.
      - Nowadays templates are designed without knowing what the actual content is, the content is added later.
      - This idea of designing distracts from what the developer should actually think about.
  - Atomic design is the idea to start with the small things. But that is just design assets, there is no real creativity in there.
  - Of course having a designer for every article is too expensive for most projects.
  - Content needs to play a central role in the design.
  - Avoid the handshake of death.
  - Copywriting can make it better: “We don’t do secret handshakes”
  - This is missing from online at the moment.
  - Copy text can be very simple and dull, for example Synergy. An image of a bee and a flower could help to enforce the message.
  - Sometimes things are like rules – Don’t define line-height in pixels, don’t do this and that.
  - But some times you need to do that stuff anyway, it depends on your context.
  - For example the smartphone is like a huge carousel.
  - F\*\*k the rules. Responsibly.
  - If you think something is best for the audience, do it.
  - Create for content.
- Development & 💩 
  - Design – Developing relationship “interesting”.
  - We need to deliver projects in time and budget and – like architects – need to work in the boundaries of what is necessary.
  - Client’s don‘t care about a certain frontend tech.
  - With technology, you have to move fast to keep up with the quick evolving technology.
  - Massive explosion of new tools in the last year.
  - To survive in an ever-changing environment you have to move faster than everyone else.
  - Developers have to think and understand everything: designers, the business and clients.
  - Balancing between being “Jack of all trades” and being “the master of one”
  - Tech is disposable after a few years. Have the courage to dump things that don’t work anymore.
  - Everyone fails at something.
  - Embrace progress
- Stakes are getting higher, projects get bigger.
- What’s the point to keep that balance.
- The journey is more important than the destination.
- Aim: To have not a factory but a family.
- Work affects our families and the other way around. So a good work environment is really needed to be happy.
