Unfortunately, due to the train strike it isn’t feasible to attend the camp. _sadface_On May 9th, I’ll attend the [IndieWebCamp Germany](https://indiewebcamp.com/2015/Germany) in Düsseldorf. It is part of the beyond tellerrand week which I will miss as I am leaving for Austin on May 10th. That means also no second day of indiewebbing for me, unfortunately.For an overview over all upcoming events I am attending, see the brand new [event calendar](/events/)!
